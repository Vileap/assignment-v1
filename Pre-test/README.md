## Tools and Technology
  To convert data from an SQL file into a CSV file using MySQL Workbench, begin by opening MySQL Workbench and connecting to your MySQL database where you intend to create the table. Import the SQL file containing table creation and data insertion queries and this action will create the necessary table and popluate them with data if your script includes INSERT statement. 
  
  Next, to export the table data as CSV file, locate the table within the schema, right-click on its name, and choose Table Data Export Wizard. Configure the export settings to specify CSV as the file format and designate a destination path for saving the CSV file.

  After the obtaining the CSV from MySQL WorkBench, the next step involves analyzing it using the Python and the Pandas library.


## Data Overview
The dataset includes two tables:

* Customers: Contains information about customers including their ID, name, gender, university, and state.

* Transactions: Records the transactions made by customers, including the transaction ID, customer ID, product, amount, and date.

***

## Observation and Insights


**1. Gender Spending Analysis**

  To calcuate it, we need to look at the data transactions and customers by combine this two table into one by using the CustomerId from Customers Table align it with CustomerId from Transaction Table.

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

path = os.getcwd()
export_path = os.path.join(path,'./insight/total-count-gender.csv')


customer = pd.read_csv("./data/customer.csv")
transactions = pd.read_csv("./data/transactions.csv")

df = pd.merge(customer, transactions, on="CustomerId")

value = df.rename(columns={0:'Username', 2:'Gender'})[['Username', 'Gender']]

summary = value.drop_duplicates('Username', keep='first')
summary

sum_total_gender = summary.groupby('Gender')['Gender'].count()
sum_total_gender 
# This line of code is for show graph in Bar chart
sum_total_gender.plot(kind='bar')
# This line of code is used for printing the table
print(sum_total_gender)
# this line of code is for printing the data to csv file.
sum_total_gender.to_csv(export_path, index=False, header=True)

```

#### Observation:
The analysis of transaction data revealed that males (Gender: M) have a higher count of transactions compared to females (Gender: F). Specifically, there were 264 transactions for males and 95 for females.

Gender | Count
-- | --
F | 95
M |  264

#### Insights:
You might find that males tend to have higher transaction compared to fameles, which could indicate different purchasing priorities or finacial behaviors.

**2. Average Monthly Student Expenses**

Description:

  To analyze the monthly student expenses using Python and Pandas, you'll typically start with a Transaction Date and Amount. Here's a structured approach to perform this analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd

customer = pd.read_csv("./data/customer.csv")
transactions = pd.read_csv("./data/transactions.csv")

df = pd.merge(customer, transactions, on="CustomerId")

df['TransactionDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['TransactionDate'], format='ISO8601')
monthly = df.groupby(by=[pd.Grouper(key='TransactionDate', freq='M')])['Amount'].mean().reset_index()
print(monthly)
```

#### Output:
Month | TransactionDate	| Amount
-- | -- | --
0	| 2023-01-31 |	1048.341707
1	| 2023-02-28 |	1063.370353
2 |	2023-03-31 |	1015.124375
3 |	2023-04-30 |	1122.768372
4	| 2023-05-31 | 956.328875
5	| 2023-06-30 | 959.833780
6	| 2023-07-31 | 1121.541778
7	| 2023-08-31 | 975.807174
8	| 2023-09-30 | 1102.982703
9 | 2023-10-31 | 1035.899213
10 | 2023-11-30 | 1039.426986
11 | 2023-12-31	| 1045.446207

![monthly-expense-student](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1998bc-86c9-4a48-804d-e615b4cd1081)

  To extract the insight from this analyze, we need to find which month is the most expense by perform the following code:
```python
  monthly.sort_values("Amount", axis=0, ascending=False, inplace=True, na_position='last')
  print(monthly)
```
#### Output 2: 
Month | TransactionDate	| Amount
-- | -- | --
3	| 2023-04-30| 1122.768372
6 |	2023-07-31 | 1121.541778
8	| 2023-09-30 | 1102.982703
1	| 2023-02-28 | 1063.370353
0	| 2023-01-31 | 1048.341707
11 | 2023-12-31 | 1045.446207
10 | 2023-11-30 | 1039.426986
9	| 2023-10-31 | 1035.899213
2	| 2023-03-31 | 1015.124375
7	| 2023-08-31 | 975.807174
5	| 2023-06-30 | 959.833780
4	| 2023-05-31 | 956.328875

#### Observation:
The average monthly spending of students shows variability throughout the year. Notable peaks in expenses were observed in April and July, with average amounts of 1122.77 and 1121.54 respectively. The lowest average spending occurred in May, with an amount of 956.33.

#### Insight:
April and July experienced the highest average expenses, indicating these months may be associated with higher spending activities or special events. The lowest spending in May suggests that students might be more conservative with their expenses during this period. Understanding these patterns could help in targeting financial products or promotional strategies during high-expense months.

df = pd.merge(customer, transactions, on="CustomerId")
summary_uni = df[['University', 'Amount']]
value = (summary_uni.Amount).groupby(summary_uni.University).sum().reset_index(name="Amount")

value.sort_values("Amount", axis=0, ascending=False, inplace=True, na_position='last')
print(value.head(10))
